Regions
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

Availability Zones
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.

Region pairs
Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. 


Azure resources and resource groups
A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

Azure subscriptions
In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.

Resources inherit permissions from their resource group.

A resource can only be in one group at a time.

VM virtualize the hardware while containers virtualize the OS.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a container orchestration service.

Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture

Public endpoints have a public IP address and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
Private endpoints exist within a virtual network and have a private IP address from within the address space of that virtual network.
