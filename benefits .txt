-- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

-- Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

--Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, 
load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. 

-- Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

--Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.And because the cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources,
 cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust and secure.

-- Management of the cloud
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.
Management in the cloud
Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

Through a web portal.
Using a command line interface.
Using APIs.
Using PowerShell.


-- Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
-- Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.

 IaaS places the largest share of responsibility with you(Customer)

 Lift-and-shift migration: You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.


-- PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.
